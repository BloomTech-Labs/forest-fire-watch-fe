*** USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS ***

- Need to be able to toggle between locations in the dashboard.
- Find active fires button in homepage needs mobile styling improvement.
- Address doesn't have radius included.
- Dynamic radius  
  - Radius is not saved with address but is instead chosen dynamically via select menu.
- Alerts are not rendering firedata
- Address form needs mobile styling improvements
- Remove opacity in navbar / mobile hamburg menu.
- View map?
  - An expanded version of the dashboard map?
- Sidebar menu items are not being rendered properly when switching from mobile to desktop view.
- Button on map to center you back over your location.
- Side nav active link styling when not logged in needs improvement.

- Distance in miles scale for mapbox?
  - https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/measure/
- Dashboard map is not showing active fires. This could be linked to the radius as there is not radius for the location I am using.
- Click on fire icons on maps to get exact distance from fire.
- No timer on how long a user's token for being logged in remains.


*** CODING IMPROVEMENTS ***

- context is not being utilized properly.
  - Several functions are not DRY.
- The data flow of getting a logged in users locations, turning it into lat / long coords and then passing coords to get firedata is not clean. Possibly move this entire functionality to backend?
- Alert provider in app.js is not being used correctly. There are a couple components being passed inside this provider as to avoid mis-rendering the components.
- Update.jsx?
- Danger.jsx?
- GlobalContext not being used for anything.
- Tokens need to be passed into a .env
- BACKEND.. Error handling for location data?
