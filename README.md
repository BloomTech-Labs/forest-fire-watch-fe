## Project Overview

Wildfire Watch is designed to help people understand when they are in danger of being struck by a wildfire, and hopefully give them time to get out.

[Trello Boards](https://trello.com/labs17forestfirewatch)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Forest-Fire-Prediction-and-Rescue-Coordination-7eb1595c5f1643fca8e48a89c6086fdf)

UX Design files: [map](https://www.figma.com/file/MSadfIggtwfQUUUp1W6dbR/Labs17_Forest-Fire-Watch%2C-Gabby?node-id=155%3A12) & [profile](https://www.figma.com/file/MSadfIggtwfQUUUp1W6dbR/Labs17_Forest-Fire-Watch%2C-Gabby)

## Key Features

### Demo view & search autocomplete

Signed out users can demo part of the the application and see a clear "Sign Up" call-to-action. Autocomplete of searched addresses are shown in a dropdown using geocoder autocomplete. Users are directed to a login modal upon attempting to save a location.

![Demo-mode](demo-mode.gif)

### Login, Registration, and Change Password Modals

Use cases for incorrect inputs based on Firebase or backend server responses are indicated to the user. User authentication is handled using Firebase.

![Modal-examples]()

### Saved locations and fire markers

Saved locations are indicated by a green marker and fires that are within a radius (in miles) of the address are highlighted with exclamation markers. Fire distances are calculated via the haversine formula (i.e. distance between two latitude/longitude points on a sphere).

![Saving a location](save-location.gif)

### User Profile

Users may edit their email address or phone number, and toggle on the options of receiving SMS alerts for saved locations.

![User-profile]()

### SMS notification alerts via Twilio API

Users can subscribe to SMS alerts. These alerts tell them the name of the closest fire and how many fires are within a given distance (user defined) from the saved locations. We send these alerts using the Twilio API. Notifications are re-sent every 6 hours using CRON scheduler.

<!-- ![SMS-alerts](twilio_notifications.png) -->

### Push notification alerts

Users can subscribe to in-browser push notifications. Like SMS alerts, they receive personalized messages based on the locations they save and the distance they set for these alerts.

![Push notifications](push_notification.gif)

### Add Location Form

Users may also add a location through a form and are prevented from adding duplicate locations.
