## Specifications

 This applicaation is designed to help people understand when they are in danger of being struck by a wild fire, and hopefully give them time to get out.



###  Key Features

-    User can log in and add multiple addresses. They can also set a distance from that address where the app will provide data about wild fires.
-    User can see wildfires within the range they set.
-    Application will alert user when  fire is withing their set radius. Either by SMS or push notification in the web browser.



## Tech Stack
  - React
  - Node.js
  - Twillio
  - MapBox

### Front end built using:

#### React 16.9

-    Everyone in project is familiar with it.

#### Hooks

-   Hooks cleans up code and reduces the need for class components.

#### Context API

-    Comes with React.
-    Works well with hooks.

#### Axios

-   For handling API requests, makes AJAX requests a lot easier.

#### MapBox

-   Free up to 25,000 users per month and 50,000 map loads per month.
-   Has a React Library.

#### Node-Sass

- Create-React-App version makes it very simple to use Sass to manage site styles.

#### Front end deployed to `Netlify`

#### [Backend](https://github.com/labs15-forest-fire/backend) built using:

#### ExpressJS

-    The popular back-end NodeJS server code makes making an API much easier.

#### KNEX

-   For management of Database Structrure.

#### BCRYPT

-   For hashing passwords, used to protect password information.

#### JWT

-   For handling authorizations.

# APIs

## Mapbox

-  This api gives the application the abilty to convert addresses to lat/long for our backend applications. Later, this will give us the ability to show more data to the users.
