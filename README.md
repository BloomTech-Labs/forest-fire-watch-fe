## Project Overview

Wildfire Watch is designed to help people understand when they are in danger of being struck by a wildfire, and hopefully give them time to get out.

## Key Features

### Demo view & search autocomplete

Signed out users can demo part of the the application and see a clear "Sign Up" call-to-action. Autocomplete of searched addresses are shown in a dropdown using geocoder autocomplete. Users are directed to a login modal upon attempting to save a location.

![Demo-mode](assets/images/demo-mode.gif)

### Login, Registration, and Change Password Modals

Use cases for incorrect inputs based on Firebase or backend server responses are indicated to the user. User authentication is handled using Firebase.

![Modal-examples](assets/images/modal-switch.gif)

### Saved locations and fire markers

Saved locations are indicated by a green marker and fires that are within a radius (in miles) of the address are highlighted with exclamation markers. Fire distances are calculated via the haversine formula (i.e. distance between two latitude/longitude points on a sphere).

![Saving a location](assets/images/save-location.gif)

### User Profile

Users may edit their email address or phone number, and toggle on the options of receiving SMS alerts for saved locations.

</p>

### SMS notification alerts via Twilio API

Users can subscribe to SMS alerts. These alerts tell them the name of the closest fire and how many fires are within a given distance (user defined) from the saved locations. We send these alerts using the Twilio API. Notifications are re-sent every 6 hours using CRON scheduler.

<!-- ![SMS-alerts](twilio_notifications.png) -->

### Push notification alerts

Users can subscribe to in-browser push notifications. Like SMS alerts, they receive personalized messages based on the locations they save and the distance they set for these alerts.

![Push notifications](assets/images/push_notification.gif)

### Add Location Form

Users can delete locations through both the map and locations list. They can add new locations through a form and are prevented from adding duplicate locations.

### Responsive Mobile View

The App is fully responsive for tablet and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

- ReactJS (Hooks)
- Node-Sass
- Axios
- MapBox
  - [React-Map-GL](https://www.google.com/search?q=react+mapbox+uber&oq=react+mapbox+uber&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.4803j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8): gives the application the abilty to convert addresses to latitude/longitude for our backend applications
  - [React Mapbox Geocode](https://github.com/groinder/react-mapbox-gl-geocoder)

### [Backend](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/forest-fire-watch-be) built using:

- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- Twilio
- Firebase: email and password based authentication
- KnexJS: management of database structure
- JWT: handling authorizations
- PostgreSQL

# Environment Variables

```
REACT_APP_VAPID_PUBLIC - for push notifications
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN - to get your own Mapbox token, go to https://docs.mapbox.com/api/#access-tokens-and-token-scopes.
REACT_APP_ENV - set to the url of your deployed Heroku backend for staging/production, default to "http://localhost:5000/api/" for local development
```

Update the fire.js file with your own Firebase information.
